# Mermaid JS ER Diagram to SQL converter

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) is Javascript diagramming and charting tool.

This VSCode extension converts [MermaidJS Entity Relationship markdown ](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html) to SQL.

.md, .mermaid and .mmd files are currently supported.

## Features

![Usage](demos/mermaidERDToSQL.gif)

> Open a valid Mermaid ER diagram file, search the command palette for "Mermaid ERD to SQL". 
The generated file will be in the same folder as the converted file.

If the basic SQL does not work with your DBMS, you can try the specific Postgres, MySQL or SQLite commands.
